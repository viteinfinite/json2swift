## Reporting Issues

A great way to contribute to the project
is to send a detailed issue when you encounter an problem.
We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too."
Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting issues, please include the following:

* The JSON payload you want to convert
* The browser you are using, including the version
* Your OS name and version
* Any other details that would be useful in understanding the problem

This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.
